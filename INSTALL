1. Make sure you have the latest source code. See the GitHub page at
   https://github.com/ricedsp/rwt
   If you have the command line git tool installed you should be able to run:
   git clone https://github.com/ricedsp/rwt.git

2. Properly set up your system to create MEX-files. Refer to the MATLAB 
   documentation section "Build MEX-Files" at 
   http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/building-mex-files.html

3. Run MATLAB and change to the "bin" subdirectory containing the .m files

4. Compile the toolbox by executing the Matlab command: compile

5. Add the toolbox "bin" subdirectory to your Matlab path.

For octave, you must compile the sources from the octave directory using the
compile.m script there. Otherwise the installation follows the same procedure
as the MATLAB instructions above. Add the toolbox "bin" subdirectory to your
Octave path.
