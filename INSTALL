1. Properly set up your system to create MEX-files. Please refer to the
   "Matlab Application Program Guide" to properly set up of your matlab
   and C-compiler to be able to compile C-mex files on your system.
   All reference documentations are available on the MathWorks web page:
   www.mathworks.com

2. Make a toolbox directory and uncompress/extract all the files.
   For example, in the unix environment,

        gunzip rwt.tar.gz
        tar xvf rwt.tar

3. Run MATLAB and change to the "bin" subdirectory containing the .m 
   files.

        compile

5. Add the toolbox "bin" subdirectory to your Matlab path.

6. High-level tests can be found in the "tests" subdirectory.  Using 
   them requires recursively adding the "tests" directory and all of
